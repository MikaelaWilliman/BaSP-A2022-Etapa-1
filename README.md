# Trackgenix
## Description: 
The company GigaTech Software Solutions SA is responsible for providing software development services to other companies.
This company has asked us for a web system that facilitates the recording of hours worked by each employee in each project and work team, which we call "Trackgenix".

### How to open: 
```
1. Access to the folder "BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1".
2.Then there, access the folder "Week 01"
3. Finally, open the file "index.html"
``` 
### Project link:
```
file:///C:/Users/mikaw/Desktop/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/Semana-03/index.html?Message=

``` 
### Week 2:
We work on Figma, on organizing how we want Trackgenix to be.
What we created was:
```
1. Landing page (Desktop, tablet, mobile)
2. Super Admin
3. App Admin
4. App Employee PM
5. App Employee 
``` 
We start with creating the html structure to start our page.
